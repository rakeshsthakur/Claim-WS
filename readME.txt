This is JAX-WS WebSerivice imlementaion for Mitchell Coding challenge, I have used cxf-architype is maven to create the 
folder structure, build the project from "Run As" -> "Maven Install" once built, I have used to tomcat8 to deploy the service,
the servie will be accessible at "http://localhost:8080/claim-ws/MitchellServices/ClaimWs?wsdl" 
once it is sucessfully built and deployed. All the dependencies are managed trough Maven.
